# Cysia Candles 🕯️
*Cysia Candles* marks my first venture into the world of e-commerce. Inspired by my partner’s occasional candle sales to friends, I decided to create an online store-like platform to showcase the products. Along the way, I introduced several new features, such as a language switcher and a theme toggle. While the app closely resembles a typical online store, Cysia Candles does not support online payments—it functions more as a showcase, allowing me to test whether I could independently build a mini e-commerce platform.
